Assignment-2: Next step in developing the personal portfolio web application through introducing interactivity and modern enhancements. 

# 🌐 Maryam Aladsani — Personal Portfolio Website

## 📝 Project Description
This is my **personal portfolio website**, designed and developed using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** to showcase my skills, volunteering experience, and contact information.  
The website emphasizes **simplicity**, **usability**, and **interactive design**.

### ✨ Key Features
- **Dynamic Greeting** — Displays a personalized message based on the time of day and stored username (via `localStorage`).
- **Contact Form with Validation** — Validates inputs in real time, shows success/error messages, and remembers user info.
- **Scroll Progress Indicator** — A thin animated line at the top of the page that fills as the user scrolls.
- **Dark/Light Mode** — Toggle between themes with persistent settings.
- **Smooth Transitions** — Subtle hover and fade animations enhance the user experience.

## 📁 Project Structure
- `index.html` — main webpage
- `css/styles.css` — global styles and animations
- `js/script.js` — handles greeting, form validation, scroll progress
- `docs/ai-usage-report.md` — detailed log of AI assistance
- `assets/` — contains all images and icons
