## Use Cases

1. **Dynamic Greeting Feature**
    - **Prompt Example:** “Help me add a personalized greeting that changes with time of day and saves username.”
    - **AI Output:** Drafted JavaScript logic for `Good morning/afternoon/evening` message and localStorage setup.
    - **My Edits:** Renamed variables, adjusted CSS to match my theme, and tested on my own layout.
   - **Learning Outcome:** Understood how to read/write from `localStorage` and attach JS to existing HTML.


2. **Contact Form Validation**
    - **Prompt Example:** “Validate my contact form with inline messages and success/error feedback.”
    - **AI Output:** Provided JS validation logic, inline error messages, and loading/success states.
    - **My Edits:** Simplified regex, added color transitions, connected with my CSS design system.
    - **Learning Outcome:** Learned client-side validation logic and how to show feedback dynamically.

3. **Scroll Progress Animation**
    - **Prompt Example:** “Add a line that fills while scrolling down.”
    - **AI Output:** Minimal JS and CSS progress bar.
    - **My Edits:** Adjusted colors to my palette and made it smoother using `transition: width .08s`.
    - **Learning Outcome:** Practiced using `scroll` events.

4. **AI Guidance & Code Review**
    - Asked ChatGPT to review my accessibility (alt texts, color contrast, ARIA labels) and to simplify hover effects.
    - Implemented its improvements manually.
